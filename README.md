# Portfolio Website

## Task
The objective of this project was to build a portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS**. The website had to include the following sections:
- Hero Banner
- Skills
- Projects
- Experience 
- Education 
- Call to Action (CTA)

## Approach
1. **Design Research**:  
   I explored various **YouTube videos** and **GitHub repositories** for design ideas and inspiration. After evaluating multiple resources, I selected a YouTube video that provided the basic layout for the **Hero Banner** and **Footer**.
   
2. **Icon Selection**:  
   I referred to another YouTube video specifically for the implementation of icons.

3. **Additional Sections**:  
   Since the initial video I chose only covered the Hero Banner and Footer, I sourced additional **videos** and **GitHub links** for other sections such as **Skills**, **Projects**, and **Experience**.
   
4. **Custom Implementation**:  
   To maintain consistency across the design, I used my own implementation while keeping the same design language throughout the website.

## Challenges
1. **Design Selection**:  
   Finding a comprehensive design that satisfied all my requirements was difficult since the YouTube videos I referred to only partially met my needs.
   
2. **Styling Other Sections**:  
   Selecting and applying CSS to sections that were not covered in the original design, such as **Skills** and **Projects**.

3. **Choosing the Right Colors**:  
   I experimented with various color combinations before finalizing the design scheme for the website.

## Solutions
1. **Design Consistency**:  
   I decided to follow one videoâ€™s design language for the **Hero Banner** and applied the same style to the other sections for consistency.

2. **Reference Materials**:  
   I used additional **YouTube videos**, **GitHub repositories**, and **ChatGPT** to help finalize the design for each section. This combination of resources, along with my own creativity, helped me design the other sections.
   
3. **Color Palette**:  
   Through trial and error, I was able to find a color palette that worked well for the design.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Portfolio Website Development**:  
   I learned how to build a simple, responsive portfolio website using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

2. **In-Depth HTML & CSS Knowledge**:  
   I gained a deeper understanding of the nuances of HTML and CSS, especially when it comes to creating layouts and styling different sections consistently.

3. **Problem Solving**:  
   I improved my ability to solve challenges one step at a time by breaking them down and tackling them individually.

4. **Time Management**:  
   Managing the project timeline was crucial in ensuring I completed the project within the given timeframe.

5. **Effective Use of Online Resources**:  
   I learned how to effectively utilize online resources like **YouTube**, **GitHub**, and **ChatGPT** to find solutions and improve my project.
